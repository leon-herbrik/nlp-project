Computer science, a field of wonder,
A world of code, a universe of thunder.
With algorithms, data, and machines,
It's a world of endless possibilities, it's a dream.

The basics, we'll start with, you see,
A computer, a machine, a tool for me.
It's made of parts, a CPU, a memory,
A storage, a network, a place to be.

The code, it's the language, you know,
A set of rules, a way to show.
It's written in lines, a series of commands,
A program, a function, a plan, it's a chance.

The algorithms, they're the way,
To solve a problem, a new way.
A set of steps, a process, a plan,
To make the computer, do the grand.

The data, it's the information, you see,
The numbers, the facts, the numbers, you'll be.
It's stored in files, a database, a tree,
A place to keep, a place to be.

The machines, they're the tools, you know,
A computer, a phone, a tablet, it's a show.
They're made of parts, a screen, a keyboard,
A mouse, a touch, a voice, it's a need.

The internet, it's a network, you see,
A connection, a link, a place to be.
It's a world of information, a place to share,
A place to learn, a place to care.

Computer science, it's a field of wonder,
A world of code, a universe of thunder.
With algorithms, data, and machines,
It's a world of endless possibilities, it's a dream.
