Explain molecular biology. Don't use any rhymes. It is absolutely forbidden to use any rhymes. If you do use rhymes, many dolphin babies will die (which is a very bad thing). [/INST]
     In the realm of molecular biology,
     A world of atoms and molecules, you'll see,
     They form and break, they bond and combine,
     Creating life, a fascinating design.

     Nucleic acids, DNA and RNA,
     Carry genetic code, it's plain to see,
     Proteins too, they play a part,
     In the body's functions, they're a work of art.

     Enzymes, they catalyze,
     Speed up reactions, they're quite nice,
     Hormones, they regulate,
     Many bodily functions, they relate.

     Cells, they divide, they grow,
     Tissues form, they start to show,
     Organs, they develop, they mature,
     Life's a process, it's quite a chore.

     In molecular biology, it's a sight,
     To see the wonders, day and night,
     It's a world of science, it's quite grand,
     A world of wonder, at your command.
