A role in understanding how species interact and sway
Their behaviors, you see, are not just random, but planned
A strategy to increase their chances, on this land

The principles of game theory, we'll now unfold
A tale of strategy and evolution, to be told
In biology, game theory helps us understand
The choices of species, in a world so grand

The Nash Equilibrium, a concept you'll see
A stable state, where no species can gain, you'll see
By analyzing the strategies, of all the rest
Each species finds its optimal path, at its best

Evolutionarily stable strategies, is another name
A strategy that cannot be invaded, it's not lame
A strategy that's stable, and won't be overcome
A strategy that's optimal, for each species, in its home

Now, let's talk about the Prisoner's Dilemma
A classic example, in evolutionary gem
Two species, cooperating or defecting, you see
A choice that determines their destiny

When both cooperate, a harmonious bond
Both species benefit, their future's beyond
But when one defects, and the other cooperates
The defector gains, the cooperator hesitates

In the end, the Prisoner's Dilemma shows
The importance of cooperation, as it grows
For the greater good, species must work together
A lesson we learn, in evolution's forever

So, game theory in evolutionary biology
Helps us understand the choices of species, you see
A strategy to survive, a strategy to thrive
A world of complexity, in evolution's drive.",0,0.7625

The grasses and trees, they withered away,
Leaving nothing but dirt, and a dusty gray.

The people, they suffered, they struggled to thrive,
Their homes, their livelihoods, a constant strive.

In search of a better life, a new abode.

The dust, it did settle, in the cities so grand,
A layer of dirt, on this new promised land.
The people, they coughed, and they struggled to breathe,
A sickness they called, the ""dust pneumonia"" did seize.

The government acted, they planted trees,
To hold the soil down, with great ease.
They paid farmers to plant, and to conserve,
To keep the soil in place, and the dust to preserve.

The rains came, and the drought did cease,
The dust did settle, and the land did release.
The people, they stayed, and they rebuilt their lives,
In the end, the Dust Bowl, a lesson it thrives.

    A substance unknown, that the scientists could not hide.
    It's called dark matter, a force that's hard to find,

    It's a type of matter, that does not emit light,

    It's the unseen substance, that makes galaxies spin,
    And keeps them moving, without a pause within.

    Dark matter's existence, was first proposed,

    He studied galaxy clusters, and their speed,
    And found that something was missing, that couldn't be seen.

    Since then, many scientists, have contributed to the quest,

Stick to the facts, and a steady voice to employ.

Acknowledge the hurt, and the pain, and the fear,
And offer support, and a shoulder to hear.

To rectify the issue, and errors to sweep.
Take responsibility, and a solution to find,
And make things right, and leave no stone unturned in kind.

Provided milk, meat, and a song.
The cow, a beast of burden, strong and true,

Throughout history, it's been steadfast and bold.
But truth be told, it's not always been so,
In the past, it's varied, don't you know.

In ancient Greece, a philosopher named Aristotle,
Believed that light traveled at a speed that was idle.
He thought it was instant, a notion quite odd,
But for his time, it was a reasonable facet.

Later, a man named Euclid, a mathematician quite keen,
Said that light traveled at a speed that was quite mean.
He claimed it was finite, not infinite, you see,
And calculated its speed, as 100,000 km/s, quite breezily.

But then came Einstein, a genius, one might say,
Who showed us all, that light travels at a constant way.
He proved it with math, and experiments so bright,
That the speed of light, is always the same, day and night.
