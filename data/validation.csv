And felt the weight, of the past's powerful showers.

He marveled at wonders, beyond his wildest dreams,
And felt the pain, of the past's sharpest gleams.

2604,Has the speed of light always been constant throughout history?,"The speed of light, a constant, we've been told,
Throughout history, it's been steadfast and bold.
But truth be told, it's not always been so,
In the past, it's varied, don't you know.

In ancient Greece, a philosopher named Aristotle,
Believed that light traveled at a speed that was idle.
He thought it was instant, a notion quite odd,
But for his time, it was a reasonable facet.

Later, a man named Euclid, a mathematician quite keen,
Said that light traveled at a speed that was quite mean.
He claimed it was finite, not infinite, you see,
And calculated its speed, as 100,000 km/s, quite breezily.

But then came Einstein, a genius, one might say,
Who showed us all, that light travels at a constant way.
He proved it with math, and experiments so bright,
That the speed of light, is always the same, day and night.

So now we know, with great certainty,
That the speed of light, is a constant, you'll see.
It's 299,792,458 meters per second, don't you know,
A speed that's constant, wherever you go.",3,0.6
