    A vector's the tool, to get the job done,
    A virus or plasmid, the work has just begun.

     Third, expression, the gene must be heard,
    To make a protein, that's the word.
    A promoter, a signal, to start the show,
    The gene springs to life, as it starts to grow.

     Fourth, selection, to pick the best,
    A way to find, the genes that pass the test.
    A marker, a tag, to identify the new,
    A way to select, what's truly true.

     Last, regulation, a step that's quite wise,
    To control the expression, before it arises.
    A switch, a dial, to turn it up or down,
    The gene's activity, without a single frown.

     These are the principles, the basics you see,
    Of genetic engineering, a science spree.
    With these guidelines, we can make a change,
    A new world, a new life, a new range.",0,0.9428571428571428

1435,Is there a limit to how tall a mountain can be?,"there once was a mountain so grand,
    It reached for the sky with its peak in hand.
    It stood tall and proud, its height so great,
    That it cast a long shadow, a wonder to greet.

    But alas! there came a day,
    When the mountain's grandeur faded away.
    Erosion took its toll,
    And the mountain's height began to dull.

    The wind and rain, they chipped away,
    At the mountain's base, day by day.
    And as the years went by,

    It shrunk and shrunk, bit by bit,
    Until it was no longer fit,
    To be called a mountain grand,
    But a hill, at best, in the land.

    There's a theory that's widely known,
    It's quantum mechanics, the principles of which,
    I'll now explain, with a rhyming touch.

    First, let's start with the wave-particle duality,
    A concept that's quite peculiar, you'll see,
    Matter can be a wave or a particle, it's true,
    Depending on how we choose to view.

    Next up, there's the principle of uncertainty,
    Which states that we can't know for sure,
    Both the position and momentum, at the same time,
    It's a rule that's quite hard to endure.

    Then there's superposition, a strange affair,
    Where a particle can be in multiple places,
    At once, it's a bizarre thought, beyond compare,
    But that's how it works, beyond a trace.

    Entanglement's another oddity,
    When particles become connected, you see,
    Their states are linked, so what happens to one,
    Affects the other, even if they're far apart, my son.

    Lastly, there's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle,
    Which states that the act of measurement,
    Can change the state of a particle, it's quite true,
    So we can't know certain things, that's just what we do.

    These principles may seem strange and odd,
    But they're the foundation of quantum mechanics,
    A field that's still evolving, as we explore,
    The mysteries of the universe, and more.

    So there you have it, a rhyming explanation,
    Of quantum mechanics, without any friction,

     That's good for the land, and the environment, you know.
     It's a method that's been around for a while,
     But now it's gaining popularity, with a smile.

     The history of regenerative ag,
     Can be traced back to the early 20th century, you see.
     When farmers began to question the way,
     They were growing their crops, and the impact it would sway.

     They realized that the soil was degrading,
     And the practices they used, were not worth the gain.
     So they started to experiment, and try,
     New methods that would improve the soil, and make it thrive.

     They found that by using cover crops,
     And crop rotation, the soil would improve, and it would cope.
     With less erosion, and better water retention,
     The crops would grow strong, and the yields would ascend.

     But that's not all, regenerative ag,
     Also helps to sequester carbon, and that's a big bag.
     By using practices like no-till, and agroforestry,
     The soil can store more carbon, and that's a great victory.

     And that's not all, regenerative ag,
     Also promotes biodiversity, and that's a big flag.
     With more wildlife, and better soil health,
     The ecosystem thrives, and that's a great wealth.

     So regenerative agriculture, it's the way,
     To grow food sustainably, and in a better way.
     It's good for the land, and the environment,
     And it's the way of the future, that's for certain.

     So support regenerative ag,
     And the farmers who practice it, let's give them a flag.
     For a better future, and healthier soil,
     Regenerative agriculture, it's the way to toil.",1,0.6

     And laws of motion, he brought to light.

     The first law, a law of rest,
     An object at rest, will stay at best,
     Unless a force, comes into play,

     An object in motion, will face a new sensation,
     Force and mass, they play a part,
     And speed and distance, they'll depart.

     The third law, a law of action and reaction,
     For every action, there's a reaction,
     A push or pull, it's a natural law,
     For every force, there's an equal draw.

     There's a science that studies the wind's embrace.

     Helps us understand flight, in all its thunder.

     The principles, my dear, are quite simple to see,
     Air flows, like a river, in a smooth breeze.
     Around objects, it moves with a curl,
     Creating lift, and a force to hurl.

     Lift is the upward force, that keeps planes aloft,
     When wings, or a body, cut through the air's soft.
     The shape of the wing, with its curve and its slope,
     Creates a pressure difference, to give it a boost.

     The air flowing faster, over the top,
     Than the bottom, where it's slow, and it's dropped.
     This difference, in speed, and in pressure,
     Creates the lift, that makes the plane feel light, and less.

     There's also drag, that acts like a brake,
     Slowing the plane, and causing it to shake.
     It's the force, that opposes the flight,
     And makes the plane, struggle to take flight.

     To make the plane, fly, night and day.
     With the right shape, and the right speed,
     The plane will soar, and all will succeed.

A stance that values freedom and the individual,
With emphasis on limited governmental intrusion, that's formal.

It's a philosophy that's rooted in the past,
With thinkers like Locke, Smith, and Hume at last,
Their ideas shaped a movement that we see,
Today, in many a nation, it's said to be.

The principles they held, are these,
Individual rights, and liberty, if you please,
Limited government, with power divided,
Checks and balances, to prevent tyranny, it's decided.

Markets should be free, with no intervention,
Economic freedom, a true liberation,
And social tolerance, without a frown,
Let people live their lives, without a gown.

So classical liberalism, a view with a heart,
That values freedom, and the individual from the start,
With government that's limited, but not apart,
A balance that's sought, with a wise and just start.",0,0.8

In a vacuum, light does race,
Faster than the speed of grace.

Faster than sound, that's a fact.

2698,Explain the principles of evolutionary psychology and human behavior.,"In the realm of evolutionary psychology,
    A field that studies human behavior, you see,
    The driving force behind our every deed,
    Is the desire to survive and propagate with speed.

    Our thoughts and actions, they all revolve,
    Around this fundamental drive, it's true,
    From finding food to finding a mate,
    Our brains are wired to perpetuate.

    Our ancestors, they struggled and fought,
    To survive in a world that was fraught,
    With danger and uncertainty, they had to be bright,
    And adapt to their environment, day and night.

    Natural selection, it played a part,
    In shaping the human heart,
    The strong and clever survived,
    While the weak and foolish died.

    And thus our behavior, it evolved,
    To prioritize self-preservation, it's solved,
    We cooperate and form groups,
    To increase our chances, we all assume.

    We help our kin and our tribe,
    For our own survival, we strive,
    We learn and adapt, we pass it on,
    Our behaviors, they're not gone.

    So here we are, with our minds,
    Governed by evolution, it's designed,
    Our behavior, it's not random,
    It's shaped by our ancestors' hand.

    Evolutionary psychology, it explains,
    Why we behave in certain ways, it sustains,
    Our actions, they're not without cause,
    They're rooted in our evolutionary past, of course.",0,0.55

1809,Describe the structure and function of the human olfactory system.,"The human olfactory system, oh so grand,
    Is responsible for the sense of smell throughout the land.
    It's made up of parts that work in harmony,
    To detect the scents that we can't see.

    The first part is the nose, so divine,
    Its shape and size are really quite fine.
    The nostrils are the entrance, you see,
    For the scent molecules to come and be.

    Inside the nose, there's a special place,
    Called the nasal cavity, a wondrous space.
    It's lined with mucous, to keep things clean,
    And tiny hairs, called cilia, are seen.

    The cilia move in a wavy way,
    Helping to filter the scent molecules all day.
    They're covered in mucous, to keep them moist,
    So they can do their job, without a flaw or boast.

    The scent molecules, they bind and cling,
    To the cilia, with a special ring.
    The ring is made of protein, so strong,
    It helps the scent molecules, all day long.

    The binding of scents, it's a special art,
    The olfactory receptors, play a part.
    They're found on the surface, of the nasal wall,
    And they help to detect, the scent of them all.

    When the scent molecules, bind to the receptors,
    A signal is sent, to the brain, in a matter of seconds.
    The brain processes the signal, with such ease,
    And we perceive the scent, with great ease.

    The olfactory bulb, is the final stop,
    It's where the brain, makes the scent, a top.
    It's a special part, of the brain, you see,
    Dedicated to the sense, of smell, it's key.

    So there you have it, the olfactory system,

     Two genes for each trait, no need to feel tame.

     Sometimes the genes can change, it's not a game.
     Mutations can occur, it's a fact, you see,
     And that's how new traits come to be.

     So now you know, it's all in the genes,
     The way you look, the way you seem.

     By the genes you got, it's a show.

     It's also health, and how your body cooks.
     Some traits are linked to health, it's true,
     And that's why knowing your genes can help you do.

     So there you have it, the process of inheritance,
     It's all about genes, it's not a pretend.
     It's how we get our traits, it's just the way,
     And understanding it can help us every day.",0,0.8142857142857143

     Capitalism emerged, a system of trade,

     A call for justice, a chance to pause.

     Communism, a radical idea,
     A classless society, a dream to be.
     Fascism, a dark force, a reign of terror,
     A dictator's rule, a world in error.

     Today, we see the rise of nationalism,

To stabilize the economy, and turn the wheel of fate.

There's money and banking, like a twist in the tale,
With interest rates and loans, and a banker's bale.
International trade, with imports and exports too,
A global economy, where all countries shine through.

Macroeconomics, it's a science, a art,

Letting heat escape, it's not too late.

A tale of love, loss, and the darkness that seeds,
In the chamber of a man, with a heart so sore,

He sits, so still, with eyes that seem to see,
Into the soul of the man, a mystery,
The raven speaks, a single word, so clear,

And guide him, through the storm, to a new show.

A message, of love, stands tall,
A reminder, that love, will never fall,

553,Discuss the role of plate boundaries in earthquakes and volcanic activity.,"In the Earth's crust, there's a special place,
     Where plates meet and create a unique race.
     They move apart, or they move aside,
     And this movement causes Earth's insides to collide.

     The plates can slide past one another with ease,
     But sometimes they get stuck, and that's when the tease.
     They build up stress, and the pressure does mount,
     Until they break, and the Earth does count.

     The breaking point comes, and the Earth does shake,
     An earthquake is born, and the ground does take.
     The shaking stops, but the damage is done,
     And the Earth's surface is forever undone.

     But plate boundaries are not just about quakes,
     They also create volcanoes, and that's no fake.
     Magma rises, and it starts to boil,
     A volcano erupts, and the lava does soil.

     The magma cools, and it solidifies too,
     And the Earth's crust is renewed, it's true.
     The plate boundaries, they play a crucial role,
     In shaping the Earth, and making it whole.

     So the next time you hear an earthquake's rumble,
     Or see a volcano, with smoke and stumble.
     Remember the plates, and the stress they bear,
     And the Earth's surface, that they help to repair.",0,0.9666666666666666

     The wonders of the universe,
     And all its secrets, they did immerse.

    And as they looked back at Earth,
     They saw a planet of rebirth,
     A home that they had left behind,
     But one that they'll forever find.

    For though they journeyed far and wide,
     The Earth will always be their bride,
     The place where they first took flight,
     And the stars, they'll forever ignite.",1,0.8444444444444444
1855,"Where is the city of Algiers located, and what historical events is it associated with?","In the land of Africa's northern shore,
Lies the city of Algiers, a place of lore.
A city rich in history, it's true,
A place of conquests, and battles, too.

The Phoenicians first settled here,
And the Romans later, they did appear.
The Arabs came, and the Ottomans too,
Each leaving their mark, as they knew.

In the 19th century, the French did invade,
And the city became a place of shade.
The Algerian War, a bloody fight,
Lasted from 1954 to 1962, a long, dark night.

But now, the city's rebirth is near,
A modern, bustling place, it's dear.
A hub of culture, art, and trade,
Algiers, a city, that's well-made.",2,0.775
2526,Is the speed of sound the same in all gases?,"In gases, the speed of sound does abide,
    A constant, unchanging, never to hide.
    In air, it's about 340 meters per second,
    A fact that's well-known, and worth a mention.

But in other gases, the speed can vary,
A different tale, you'll see, my dear.
In helium, it's faster, a fact so bright,
About 965 meters per second, a wondrous sight.

In hydrogen, it's slower, don't you see,
About 267 meters per second, a statistic to me.
In nitrogen, it's 245, a number so fine,
A speed that's consistent, all the time.

So, to sum it up, in gases we find,
The speed of sound varies, and that's divine.
A fact that's interesting, and worth a quote,
In different gases, the speed's not the same, no doubt.",3,0.625

A device to help us understand,
Their language, their thoughts, their every demand,

Their voices translated, never to die,
A bond between us, never to deny,
A way to communicate, never to buy.

A way to connect, intertwined,
A bridge between man and plant, so fine,
A tool that makes our bond align.

A world where man and plant can release.",1,0.9

1319,What is the role of the amygdala in the human brain?,"The amygdala's role, I shall explain,
     It's a part of the brain, profound and plain.
     It's a tiny almond-shaped structure, you see,
     That plays a big role in emotions, as bright as can be.

     It's responsible for detecting fear and stress,
     And helps to trigger the body's distress.
     It's linked to the hypothalamus, don't you know,
     To release hormones and make the heart go slow.

     The amygdala's job is quite vital, indeed,
     It helps us to react, with speed and great heed.
     It's a guardian of sorts, always on the lookout,
     To keep us safe, without a single doubt.

     So here's to the amygdala, a hero in our midst,
     A tiny but mighty part of the brain's mist.
     It may be small, but its role is grand,
     A vital piece of our emotional brand.",2,0.85

     Our minds take flight, the skies are filled with surprise.

     Castles rise, mountains fall,
