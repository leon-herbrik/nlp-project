A role in understanding how species interact and sway
Their behaviors, you see, are not just random, but planned
A strategy to increase their chances, on this land

The principles of game theory, we'll now unfold
A tale of strategy and evolution, to be told
In biology, game theory helps us understand
The choices of species, in a world so grand

The Nash Equilibrium, a concept you'll see
A stable state, where no species can gain, you'll see
By analyzing the strategies, of all the rest
Each species finds its optimal path, at its best

Evolutionarily stable strategies, is another name
A strategy that cannot be invaded, it's not lame
A strategy that's stable, and won't be overcome
A strategy that's optimal, for each species, in its home

Now, let's talk about the Prisoner's Dilemma
A classic example, in evolutionary gem
Two species, cooperating or defecting, you see
A choice that determines their destiny

When both cooperate, a harmonious bond
Both species benefit, their future's beyond
But when one defects, and the other cooperates
The defector gains, the cooperator hesitates

In the end, the Prisoner's Dilemma shows
The importance of cooperation, as it grows
For the greater good, species must work together
A lesson we learn, in evolution's forever

So, game theory in evolutionary biology
Helps us understand the choices of species, you see
A strategy to survive, a strategy to thrive
A world of complexity, in evolution's drive.",0,0.7625

The grasses and trees, they withered away,
Leaving nothing but dirt, and a dusty gray.

The people, they suffered, they struggled to thrive,
Their homes, their livelihoods, a constant strive.

In search of a better life, a new abode.

The dust, it did settle, in the cities so grand,
A layer of dirt, on this new promised land.
The people, they coughed, and they struggled to breathe,
A sickness they called, the ""dust pneumonia"" did seize.

The government acted, they planted trees,
To hold the soil down, with great ease.
They paid farmers to plant, and to conserve,
To keep the soil in place, and the dust to preserve.

The rains came, and the drought did cease,
The dust did settle, and the land did release.
The people, they stayed, and they rebuilt their lives,
In the end, the Dust Bowl, a lesson it thrives.

    A substance unknown, that the scientists could not hide.
    It's called dark matter, a force that's hard to find,

    It's a type of matter, that does not emit light,

    It's the unseen substance, that makes galaxies spin,
    And keeps them moving, without a pause within.

    Dark matter's existence, was first proposed,

    He studied galaxy clusters, and their speed,
    And found that something was missing, that couldn't be seen.

    Since then, many scientists, have contributed to the quest,

2331,Has the North Star always been the North Star throughout history?,"The North Star, a beacon in the sky,
Has guided many, and caught the eye,
Of travelers, sailors, and explorers of old,
A constant point, their journeys to unfold.

But has it always been the same, we ask?
The answer is no, for in the past,
Other stars have played a similar role,
In different cultures, with different souls.

The Egyptians had their own star,
Sirio, they called it from afar,
The Greeks had Cynosura, their guide,
And the Polynesians, a different tide.

But now, the North Star stands apart,
A shining light, a guiding spark,
For navigation, it's the star of choice,
A constant presence, a reliable voice.

So though the North Star has not always been,
The one and only, it's the one that's seen,
Today, it's the star that we rely on,
To guide us through, to the rising sun.",3,0.6799999999999999

     A tale of DNA, and how it's told.
     Replication, a feat so grand,
     A double helix, hand in hand.

     Two strands, entwined, a spiral stair,
     A code so complex, beyond compare.
     Unwind the strands, the dance begins,
     An enzyme, helicase, spinning within.

     Unzipping, the double helix breaks,
     A single strand, a template it makes.
     Free nucleotides, building a chain,
     A complement, a perfect gain.

     Matching base by base, a pair at a time,
     Cytosine and guanine, intertwined in rhyme.
     Adenine and thymine, side by side,
     Hydrogen bonds, a stable ride.

     A new strand, a copy exact,

Ethiopia and Eritrea, a bitter fray
Causes abound, like a heavy cloud
Eritrea sought freedom, a loud crowd

Effects were dire, a region in pain
Thousands died, displaced, in vain
Economies shattered, a barren land
No victors, just suffering, at hand

Historical baggage, a heavy load
Colonial legacy, a weighty toad
Nationalism rose, a fiery flame
Tensions boiled, a people in shame

The Cold War, a distant shadow
Superpowers meddled, a woeful shadow
Arms race fueled, a dangerous game
Wars breed wars, a vicious frame

Ethnic strife, a deep-seated fear
Tigrinya, Tigray, a lingering tear
Border disputes, a long-standing gripe
Badme, a flashpoint, a burning pipe

National interests, a delicate dance

A lasting peace, a fervent produce

Peace is key, a path anew.",0,1.0
